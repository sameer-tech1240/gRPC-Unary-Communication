# Book Search Application

This is a simple Book Search web application built using **Angular** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend.  
The application allows users to search for books by their ID and view detailed information including title, author, genre, and published year.

## Features

- Search book by ID
- Display detailed book information
- User-friendly and responsive UI with validation
- Integration with a RESTful backend service

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Angular (Standalone components, HttpClient, FormsModule)
- Backend: Spring Boot (REST API)
- Communication: HTTP REST
- Styling: CSS for clean and modern UI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Angular CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- Java JDK 11+ installed
- Maven or Gradle for backend build

### Installation & Running

git clone https://github.com/your-username/gRPC-Unary-Communication.git
cd book-search-app

Step 2: Run Backend (Spring Boot + gRPC)
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Backend gRPC server runs on port 9090

REST API (if applicable) runs on port 8080

Step 3: Run Frontend (Angular)
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve

Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:4200

üß© How It Works 
1 : User enters a Book ID in the search field.

2 : Angular frontend sends a request to the Spring Boot backend using gRPC unary call.

3 : Backend queries the data source and returns the Book details.

4 : Frontend displays the book information or an error message if not found.

üîé Sample Usage
Try searching with the following sample Book ID:
Book ID: 101
